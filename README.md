# QUAC
QUAC is an Spark(pySpark) implementation of the Maximal Gamma quasi clique algorithm .This algorithm is described in the paper given in the below link
http://aluru-sun.ece.iastate.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=papers:closet-wp.pdf

 The algorithm focuses on finding the maximal quasi cliques for very large graphs using map-reduce implementation.In this project, the algorithm is implemented in pySpark
